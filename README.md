# hamm-hebamme
This is a website to display information about available Hebammer in Hamm (Westfalen).
The main goal of this website is for pregnant women to easily find available hebamme located in Hamm.
A second goal could be to display a list of courses located in Hamm for pregnant women (vorbereitungskurse, yoga, ...).
Only authorized hebamme could register as such (So an authentication system need to be implemented where only a list of person would be allowed to create an account). So that a verification that they actually are hebamme could be done. Therefore we prevent the website to be polluated with scams or irrelevant information.
The main page could have banners to promote certain courses. This feature could generate income by renting the space to hebamme who would like their courses to be advertised.
A map could be implemented to display the location of all available courses. That feature would be a very visual and user-friendly way to list available courses.
